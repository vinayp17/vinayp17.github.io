# Fine-tuning Llava for Time Series Classification Tasks

Welcome to our comprehensive guide on fine-tuning the Llava model for time series classification tasks. This site will provide you with all the necessary information and steps to successfully fine-tune Llava, covering both univariate and multivariate time series datasets.


## Introduction

Llava is a powerful model for various machine learning tasks. Fine-tuning it for time series classification can significantly improve performance in your specific use case.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of machine learning and time series data.
- Python installed on your system.
- Llava library and its dependencies installed.

## GitHub Repository

You can find the complete codebase for this project on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vinayp17/VLM-TSC).

## Datasets Considered

We have considered a diverse set of datasets for our time series classification tasks. These include:

### Univariate Time Series Datasets
- **TwoLeadECG**: A dataset of ECG signals with two leads.
- **CinCECGTorso**: ECG signals recorded from the torso.
- **FreezerSmallTrain**: Temperature readings from a small freezer.
- **PhalangesOutlinesCorrect**: Outlines of phalanges from X-ray images.
- **ItalyPowerDemand**: Power demand readings from Italy.

### Multivariate Time Series Datasets
- **PenDigits**: Handwritten digit data with multiple features.
- **HandOutlines**: Outlines of hand shapes.

## Data Generation

To generate data for a specific datasource, follow these steps:

1. Edit the `configs/llava_config.yaml` file to specify the appropriate dataset, downsampling, and rounding parameters.
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   python dataset.py configs/llava_config.yaml```

## Steps to Fine-tune Llava

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Gather and preprocess your time series data.
2. **Model Configuration:**
   - Configure Llava for your specific task.
3. **Training:**
   - Train the model with your data.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance.
